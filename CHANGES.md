# Changes

## 2026-06-08

- Added a compile-backed `npm test` gate and a source baseline check for the VS
  Code webview sample.
- Aligned `package.json` with the checked-in TypeScript and ESLint lockfile
  baseline.
- Hardened the sidebar webview with a content security policy, nonce-scoped
  script, narrower local resource roots, and validated extension-host messages.
